  <article>My Story

    From Theatre & Barwork to empowering women into Tech!
    
    Growing up I was always exposed to performing arts and creativity, I attended the local dance school and would be entered by my teacher into the local poetry competitions “Away with words-West Midlands” etc. I always wanted to succeed at something and achieve my goals so I always worked hard at these things.
    
    However, I secretly loved I.T lessons and found it interesting also, but that was for boys “the extra clever male students”, where as I was destined to be a typical “performer” …if I even succeeded professionally.
    
    This impacted my chooses in my early 20’s, I studied performing arts and theatre at college whereby then (like so many others) I had completely lost any hope/desire of becoming a “performer”.
    
    I then studied and gained a HND in Media and communications which was slightly more interesting however not exactly what I wanted. I found myself on a work placement in an office full of white males and computers and felt alien.
    
    Put of by this tech experience I decided to go back to university and study what I new which was performing arts. Alongside my studies I worked part-time in 3mobile where I enjoyed working with the latest technology and my colleagues. I decided to explore backstage roles in theatre, I was then offered a summer placement with National theatre wales shadowing a stage-manager on a show in Cardiff. 
    
    After university, I moved to Cardiff to further pursue a career in theatre. I worked full-time for a theatre company as an Assistant Director, Administrator and also co-ran Youth theatre Workshops (for under-privileged children) on the weekend which I enjoyed. Did I mention that I also worked at a bar on the weeknights? I was living life; however, I was constantly burnt-out and unfulfilled. Eventually over 3years my side hustle bar work turned into my main source of income and I was extremely depressed. I needed what Stormzy said “…to find a Purpose”
    
    I realised something wasn’t right, I missed technology. During covid-11 I was listening to the radio, and heard that a London based company were running a free bootcamp for women (specifically from and ethnic minority) to encourage the female BAME community to be more involved in the Tech Industry, which is highly male dominated. I was over the moon, I thought this had been created for me…right? 
    
    I applied for the course and the rest is history I am 4 weeks in and loving Software Development, I’m learning things I never new existed, such as; Coding to create websites from scratch. On a weekly basis I get to see empowering women who have transitioned into tech roles which is inspirational. I’m proving that you don’t have to be an extremely clever man to be in tech, women can do it too! I’m loving my new found career path, ignoring the out-dated gender stereotypes and excited to continue the journey, I hope to inspire the next generation of females that you can do this and technology is for us too!
