    <h2>Smear Test</h2>
    <h3>03/09/20</h3>

      <p>I'm 29 and I went for my second ever smear test,my first was when I was 25 at university. 
     I thought nothing of it I knew only of the importance of going to have them since Jade Goody 
     passed away from her diagnosis of Cervical Cancer.I went for the test at the same time as my Mom.
      A few days later my Mom recieved her test results which were fine, thats when I was a little unnerved 
      about my test since we had them at the same time and I hadnt recieved any results. My letter finally arrived 
      </p>

    <h2>The Letter</h2>
    <h3>18/09/20</h3>
     <p>The letter finally arrived, at first I glanced at it and then assumed it was fine as you do with medical results
     when you're young you just skim to the part where it says all clear etc. After putting the letter down I told my Mom it was fine. 
     But then something inside told me to have another look at the letter to double-check. The letter read 
     <em>Thank you for your cervical screening. </br> Your results show that you have HPV(human papillomavirus). This is called 'HPV positive' result...</em>
     It further went on to explain how this was a common virus most people will have at some point in their life without knowing, which usually 
     goes away on its own. However sometimes it can be long-lasting, and this may cause abnormal cells in the cervix. The cells can then over time, turn into cancer
     if left untreated.
     </br>
     <em>We tested your sample for abnormal cervical cells. We found changes to some of the cells in your cervix called 
    'high grade(moderate)dyskaryosis'. In almost all cases these cell changes <strong>not</strong> found to be cancer, but we would like you
    to come for further examination</em>
    </p>

    <h2>The Examination</h2>
    <p>The examination is called <strong>Colposcopy</strong>. This was similar to a cervical screening and took place in the
      hospital outpatient clinic. For more information on this procedure please follow this link. </p> <!--Add link to NHS page-->
    </br>
    <p>At the Hospital, I was welcomed at the entrance with a medical face mask (coronavirus precaution) and hand sanitizer,only
        to be told that my Mom wouldn't be able to come to the appointment with me as due to coronavirus the hospital is only allowing
        elderly to have support. My immediate thoughts were; <em>So because of coronavirus I'm not allowed emotional support, for a relativley
        traumatic procedure.</em> I beleive there are truly many flaws within the NHS (which my Mom also works for as a Practice Nurse of 30+ years)
        She pleaded with the desensitized unempathetic women to allow her to accompany me, to which she referred us to security who said we would have to gain 
        permission from the reception on the treatment floor then phone my Mom to come up...(this seemed a massive ordeal)and it is worth mentioning that this section of 
        the hospital was reletavily quiet. This is not an attack on the staff for following orders, this is just an account of the initial negative experience.
        </br>
        However fast forward to the waiting room where I waited for 30mins to hear my name called, the nurses alllowed my Mom in the room.
        I was greeted by three nurses, the nurse in charge sat me down and discussed briefly the procedure I was going to have,that I showed high grade
        dyskaryosis.  I then signed for the go ahead for a Loop Diathermy Treatment which removes pre-cancerous tissue from the cervix.
        form to confirm this.
    </br>
    The only way I can explain the procedure is that it is not painlfull but uncomfortable. I'd rather not be legs spread for this but for pregnacy
    , however the nurses were extremly supportive and guided me through the process step by step. As morbid as it sounds it was quite interesting
    viewing my cervix from a screen and this anatomy I've never seen before. Then came the anisthetic which the nurse described to be as like <i>vinegar</i>
    and stings a little, to be honest I have quite a high pain threshold due to having the monthly experience of a period so this procedure was 
    light-work and relativley painfree. Next was 4 injections which are slightly sharp but barebly. After this I had

   <h2>Immediate Thoughts post Colposcopy</h2>
    <p>Do I tell anyone?Who do I tell? I don't want people to feel sorry for me? </p>

  </div>





   <h2>Awaiting the Results</h2>
  <ul>Restrictions</ul>
  <li></li>

  <h2>Feelings</h2>
  <li>Obsessive Thoughts- How will I focus on my studies/work.</li>
  <li>Sad-Overwhelmingly,depressed</li>
  <li>Lonely-I don't have a partner or anyone to burden my thoughts and feelings with, and I wouldn't want to do that even if I did</li>
  <li>Guilty-Like most young people I've experimented with recreational substances but never to the point of addiction more so for the experience. 
      there's always that fear was this self-inflicted, could it have been avoided?
  </li>
  <li>Scared-What if it comes back?Will I die? Generally I think as humans we are scared of things that we can't control</li>

    <h3>Hopefully awaiting...</h3>
    <p>The next step is to await the results from the cells that were removed.</p>
</br>
    <p>Meanwhile I don't want to deteriate, I don't want to dwell although it would be so easy to sit in a bucket full of tears and wo is me.
        No I'm stronger than that, I can fulfill m dreams, I will continue...
    </p>

    <h3>Don't Worry</h3>
    <p>It's worth mentioning that prior to my examination I didn't read anything about HPV(Human Papilloma Virus) or Dyskaryosis because I
        didn't want to worry and send myself into a googling spiral. However recieving trustworthy information from the nurses and then follow-up reading
        on the NHS website I understand the process a lot better.
